# Include Folder README

This folder contains global configuration headers and shared definitions used across the DAQ firmware. These files centralize system-wide settings so that modules stay consistent and easy to maintain.

## `SystemConfig.h`

This header provides core configuration constants and enums used throughout the DAQ firmware.

### **1. ADC I2C Address Map**

The `ADCAddress` enum defines the I2C addresses for each ADS1115 ADC chip.

```
U1 → 0x48
U2 → 0x49
U3 → 0x4A
U4 → 0x4B
```

Use these when instantiating sensor objects to ensure each sensor communicates with the correct ADC.

---

### **2. Logging Configuration**

The firmware uses a global log level filter to control output verbosity.

Current setting:

```
CURRENT_LOG_LEVEL = LOG_LEVEL_VERBOSE (6)
```

Log levels:

* `0` Silent — no logs
* `1` Fatal
* `2` Error
* `3` Warning
* `4` Notice
* `5` Trace
* `6` Verbose (all logs)

Logging decimal precision:

```
LOG_DECIMAL_PLACES = 5
```

Controls number of decimal places when printing floats/doubles using `%D` or `%F`.

---

### **3. Serial Communication Settings**

Global serial baud rate:

```
BAUD_RATE = 115200
```

Used by all modules and must match the serial monitor configuration.

---

### **4. Time Constants**

Defined in seconds and milliseconds for timing calculations:

```
MSECS_PER_SEC = 1000
SECS_PER_MIN = 60
SECS_PER_HOUR = 3600
SECS_PER_DAY = 86400
```

These support time-based logic across sensors and fault handling.

---

## Usage Guidelines

* **Do not duplicate constants** in other files; always include `SystemConfig.h`.
* **Only add universal settings** here—module‑specific configs should stay in their own headers.
* When updating I2C addresses or log levels, **update this file only**, not each module.

---

If you add more global configuration files (e.g., `CANConfig.h`, `SensorConfig.h`), document them here in the same format.
